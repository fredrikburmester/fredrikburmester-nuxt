# Hi, I'm Fredrik. <br>I love building websites and teaching people about tech

I'm currently studying at Linköping University, doing my masters in Mediatechnology.

I'm a student at Linköping Univeristy, studying a masters of science in [Media Technology and Engineering](https://liu.se/utbildning/program/6cmen), and I'm currently working as a web developer at [Sigbit](https://www.significantbit.se/).

I have a passion for programming. I create everything from APIs or small programs in Python to full-stack websites with advance database structures. Most of my project I self-host and managed from my own server at home.

Check out some of my [projects](/projects) to see what I'm working on!
